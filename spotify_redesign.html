          <h3>Challenge</h3>
          <p>Spotify promised their users “There are millions of tracks on Spotify. So whether you’re working out, partying or relaxing, the right music is always at your fingertips.” Being a Spotify user myself, I challenged myself to dive deeper as a UX designer, and teamed up with Rashmi and Torin to explore whether current content organization and navigation scheme of Spotify iOS App allow the users to access new music easily and efficiently.</p>

        <div class="grids col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">
          <h3>Solution</h3>
          <p>Through a User-Centered Design approach, we performed a 10-week usability testing project, while we developed a full usability study test kit, run 7 testing sessions, completed data compiling and analysis, and created redesign interactive prototype and mockup.</p>

          <h3 class="centered-h3">Major Findings</h3>
          <div class="section col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">
            <h4>Social Feature Problem | Non-existing Notifications</h4>
            <p>After asking the participants what they expect to happen after following a friend or an artist, participants
            expected to be notified about the feeds, such as artists'new releases, friends' new playlists, etc. However,
            the participants then found that there were no notifications about any of the above, unless a post
            is created or sent directly to another user.</p>
            <p>As shown in the screenshot below, for example, when a friend creates a
            new playlist, users dont'get any feeds from their end but still with "No recent activity."</p>
            <img src="spotify/notifications.jpg" class="img-responsive"/>
            <h4>Social Feature Problem | Confusing Terminology</h4>
            <p>When it comes to sharing music playlists using Spotify App, Spotify has two options on its menu navigation: 1) Share and 2) Make Collaborative.
            Generally speaking, "Share" is meant to have multiple functions on a music App, including sharing the playlist on social media,
            as well as opening up the playlist for a friend to add songs to the list once it becomes collaborative.
            Making a playlist collaborative allows the user to then share
            the playlist with a friend to add to it. These two actions caused confusion for the participants.</p>
            <img src="spotify/share.jpg" class="img-responsive"/>
          </div>

          <div class="section col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">
            <h4>Personalized New Music</h4>
            <p>Another major finding that we revealed is that finding personalized new music can be difficult and
            overwhelming, which contradicts Spotify’s mission, “...the right music is always at your fingertips.”
            By personalized new music, we are referring to recommended music suggested by Spotify based
            on users’ personal music preferences, which could be new releases from artists that users
            followed, playlist containing songs in the same genre with the ones in users’ library and etc.</p>
            <br/>
            <h4>Difficulty in Finding Personalized New Music | Hidden Discover Section</h4>
            <p>Spotify has a specific section called Browse, as shown in the image below, as a main option under the
            navigation menu. However, the quickly accessible music on the Browse page are not unique
            music recommendations for different users; most of the contents are either general new released
            music or music in trend. In fact, Spotify does have a section called Discover for personalized new
            music for different users; unfortunately, it has been placed in a spot, the fourth option in the list, which seems not to be
            designed for quick access in the current version of Spotify.</p>
            <img src="spotify/browse_discover.jpg" class="img-responsive"/>
            <h4>Difficulty in Finding Personalized New Music | Vague Titles</h4>
            <p>Some titles for recommended music categories in Discover need more
            clarifications on the differences of the contents under those titles. For example, Spotify labeled
            recommended music based off artists that users listened with “Because You Listened to...” and
            “Suggested for You Based on…,” as shown below. When were asked for explaining the differences
            between the contents under each of the two titles, 6out of 7 participants didn’t give us a confident explanation,
            with 4 out those 6 guessing that wording could be the only difference other than the contents.</p>

                    <h3 class="centered-h3">Heuristic Evaluation</h3>
                    <p>To determine what areas of Spotify mobile our team should focus on, we created a heuristic evaluation. the heuristic evaluation was
                      broken up into larger categories including <b>Navigation menu, Search, Browse, Radio, Your Music, Customization, and Error messages</b>.
                      These categories contained evaluation questions such as “are the user’s past keywords saved? Do the icons relate to the labels in the sub
                      navigation?” and so on.</p>
                      <p>Each team member explored the app and answered the evaluation questions with a “yes” or “no” as applicable.
                      After compiling all three evaluation forms, we found that the areas that were least effective in terms of functionality and clarity
                      included finding music through the Browse page, consistency between terminologies, and using the hamburger icon to navigate and explore the app.</p>
                  </div>

                  <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">
                    <h3 class="centered-h3">Refining Research Questions</h3>
                    <p>With the information from the Heuristic Evaluations, we then brainstormed a list of possible research questions
                      which would reflect how we design our usability test later on. An example of our list of questions is below: </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>How easily can users create a radio station?</li>
                      <li>Can users distinguish between creating a radio station and creating a playlist?</li>
                      <li>How easily can users create a playlist?</li>
                      <li>How easily can users add songs to a playlist and share the playlist with a friend?</li>
                      <li>How many clicks on average does it take the user to access their recommended songs?</li>
                      <li>Can users locate and play a song they saved in their playlist?</li>
                      <li>Do users expect instant access to recommended music on the frontpage of Browse?</li>
                      <li>Do the icons used in the user interface of Spotify Free mobile App help users to better implicate the according functions of the terms?</li>
                      <li>Do Spotify users use the social features?</li>
                      <li>What the social features of a music player would bring to users beyond music accessibility?</li>
                      <li>How often do users refer to the navigation menu to accomplish certain task when there are alternative paths?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These questions started off as too specific and task-related, however we focused on what all of the questions had in common.
                    An overarching theme throughout these questions centered around the user’s ability to find new music through various methods
                    including Browse, Radio, and social features. <b>Going back to Spotify’s mission to make music as a whole accessible to their users
                    - we decided to focus our usability study on tasks that show us how users find, share, and music and playlists, and how users
                    customize their content. </b>With this area of focus, we were able to evaluate where the Spotify mobile app could be improved to
                    make these core processes easier for their users. </p>
                </div>

                  <h3 class="centered-h3">Participants & Screening Questions</h3>
                  <p>For the study, we recruited a total of seven participants. Four participants are female, three are male, and all participants are college students at the University of Washington between the ages of 18-25 years old. All of the participants chosen met our pre-screening requirements and listen to Spotify on their mobile devices an average of 2-4 hours per day. Six participants use an iPhone and one participant uses an Android device.</p>
                    <p>Our target audience for Spotify Mobile are college-aged students who are familiar with the app, but do not necessarily know about every feature Spotify mobile has to offer. Due in part to our screening questionnaire and environment, all of our study participants matched the criteria to be the target audience. </p>
                </div>

                <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">
                  <h3 class="centered-h3">Pre-Test Questionnaire</h3>
                  <p>Before starting the task walkthroughs, we asked each participant to answer a few questions to get an idea of their experience with Spotify mobile. Questions asked included how the participant would rate the ease of use of Spotify mobile on a Likert scale of 1-10, 10 being the most difficult.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>What is the participant's favorite features on Spotify?</li>
                    <li>What are the other music streaming services the participant uses, if any?</li>
                    <li>In what situations does the participant use Spotify mobile?</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>The pre-test questionnaire took an average of 4 minutes to complete per participant.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">
                  <h3 class="centered-h3">Task Design & Scenarios</h3>
                  <p>Since we wanted to measure the ease and efficiency of Spotify’s mobile features, we broke up
                    the usability test into six tasks - each testing out a different action that a user might do to discover
                    new music through Spotify recommendations, radio, and social circles/friends. Some tasks
                    contained subtasks that further tested out the same feature, or otherwise was an action that
                    would naturally follow in the task order. Follow up questions were asked depending on the
                    actions of the participant during the task.</p>
                  <p>For each task we started by providing the participant with an applicable scenario to provide
                    context and observe the participant’s natural response. From our screening questionnaire, we
                    were able to determine that most users use Spotify mobile when they are walking to/from a
                    destination, working out, or at a social event without access to their laptops or tablets.</p>

                    <h4>Task 1</h4>
                    <p>Scenario: You are taking a bus home and you want to listen to something new that's not in your
                    playlist.</p>
                    <p>Task: Find a recommended playlist by Spotify that you are interested in and play a song in the
                    playlist</p>

                    <h4>Task 2</h4>
                    <p>Scenario: You really enjoy listening to a specific artist and you want to listen to a similar artist.
                      Please go back to the Navigation page and</p>
                    <p>Task: Discover a similar artist and play a song
                      Follow up question: What content do you expect to be under each of these subheadings?
                      (“suggested for you based on…” and “because you listened to…”)</p>
                    <p>Sub Task: Now follow the suggested artist</p>
                    <p>Follow up question: What type of content would you expect to be notified about</p>

                    <h4>Task 3</h4>
                    <p>Scenario: You have a favorite artist that you listen to when you go on a run. This time, you want to
                      listen to a radio station with songs from that artist. Please start at the Navigation page and</p>
                    <p>Task: Start a radio station on an artist that you have recently played</p>

                    <h4>Task 4</h4>
                    <p>Scenario: You want to rearrange the order of the songs in one of your playlists for a party at your
                      house tonight. Please start at the Navigation page, open a playlist and</p>
                    <p>Task: Change the order of the first and second song.</p>
                    <p>Sub Task 1: You really like the first song in the playlist, go ahead and save it</p>
                    <p>Sub Task 2: Navigate to where the location of the saved song.</p>

                    <h4>Task 5</h4>
                    <p>Scenario: One of your friends has had good music suggestions and you want to take your
                      friendship to the next level on Spotify</p>
                    <p>Task: Starting from the Navigation page, follow a friend on Spotify.</p>
                    <p>Follow up question: Now that you are following a friend, what type of content would you expect
                      to be notified about?</p>
                    <p>Sub Task: Play a public playlist from your friend’s Spotify music collection</p>

                    <h4>Task 6</h4>
                    <p>Scenario: You are having a party tonight and want to create a new playlist.</p>
                    <p>Task: Please start at the navigation page and create a new playlist and include a song of your
                      choice.</p>
                    <p>Sub Task: Your friend is co-hosting this party with you and you would like to share this playlist

                    took to complete the task, and on average if it took the participant more, less, or average time to
                    complete than they expected.</p>
                  <p>Each post-task questionnaire took an average of 1 minute to complete.</p>

                  <h3 class="centered-h3">Post-Test Questionnaire</h3>
                  <p>The purpose of the post-test questionnaire was to debrief the entire test with the participant and
                    give the participant time to talk through any particular task or challenge. The questions included
                    how the participant rates the ease of use of Spotify mobile on a Likert scale of 1-10, 10 being the
                    most difficult; what tasks the participant enjoyed/did not like, if any; what the participant
                    likes/dislikes about Spotify’s mobile app; and if there were any new features discovered through
                    the usability test.</p>
                  <p>On average, the post-test questionnaire took 5 minutes to complete for each participant.</p>

                  <h3 class="centered-h3">Usability Test Set Up</h3>
                  <p>Our usability tests were held at the Allen Research Commons at the University of Washington.
                    The Allen Research Commons is an open space on the bottom floor of a library containing
                    multiple tables, booths, and group work areas. This environment was chosen for usability testing
                    because it is an area where students often work in groups, therefore the noise level is
                    comfortable for people to talk at a normal volume. We wanted our participants to be able to talk
                    freely and openly during testing without worrying about being too loud in a library setting.</p>
                  <br/>
                  <h4>Researcher Roles & Data Collection</h4>
                  <p>For each usability test, we had one moderator, one quantitative notetaker, and one qualitative
                    notetaker.</p>
                  <p>Prior to running the usability tests, we had set up a Google Form containing the pre-test
                    questionnaire, 6 post-task questionnaires, and the post-test questionnaire. The quantitative
                    note-taker filled out one Google Form for each participant.</p>
                  <p>We also used a usability tool called Lookback on the testing device. Lookback recorded a
                    screen-captured video of the user going through the screens for each task. After uploading the
                    video for each participant, Lookback automatically marked timestamps for when the user
                    switched screens. This allowed us to collect quantitative data on the time it took the participants
                    to complete each task.</p>
                  <p>Qualitative notes were collected via the think-aloud protocol conducted on each participant. The
                    qualitative notetaker listen and typed up everything the participant said out loud and also
                    watched the testing device marking down the interactions.</p>

                    Appendix, which is organized by tasks. The quantitative data includes the timing for task
                    completion, variability for task timing, likert scale in pre-test and post-test questionnaires, and
                    task completion evaluation in post-task questionnaires.</p>

                    sticky notes. We ended up with putting all the sticky notes randomly on the wall, and grouping
                    them into <b>4 different themes: unclear terminology, confusing navigation, the differences between
                    participants’ expectation and reality, struggles to find personalized new music and struggles to

                <h4>I. Unclear Terminology</h4>
                <p>The Spotify mobile App contains terminologies that are unclear in accordance with the outcomes
                  of those actions.</p>
                <p><b>“Save” a Song</b></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Participants struggled determining if this action would save the song locally to the phone, or to a playlist.</li>
                  <li>4 out of 7 participants were unsure where the saved songs were stored when
                  asked a follow up question about saved song location.</li>

                <p><b>“Share” a Playlist vs. “Make Collaborative” a Playlist</b></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Participants were unsure about the differences between “share” and “make collaborative.”</li>
                  <li>Participants were unsure about the what will be brought to them if they make a
                    playlist collaborative.</li>
                  <li>5 out of 7 participants questioned the corresponding results of these two options</li>

                <p><b>Music Recommendation Titles</b></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>There are several sections under Spotify’s recommended music labeled with
                    different titles, and some of the titles seemed to be repetitive and overlapping.</li>
                  <li>Participants were asked to describe what contents they would expect to see
                    under “Because You listened to...” and “Suggested for You based on…,”</li>
                  <li>6 out of 7 didn’t provide us confirm explanations about the differences between

                    artist, song, or playlist.</li>
                  <li>Search bar was used to look for features that were present elsewhere on the app

                <p><b>Hidden “Saved” Songs</b></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Depending on how the user interpreted the “save” function, users were unaware
                    that saved songs were included under the “Songs” section in “My Library”</li>
                  <li>4 out of 7 participants took multiple tries to find where saved songs were located
